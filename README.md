# Predictive Modelling Competition üê£


### LAST GROUP ACTIVITY! üëπ

For this group project, we will be using the Bird Species dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) which will test your skills in image classification

You will have two days for this project (this can be done in one day). Your goal is to download the dataset from Kaggle.

This is a group project and you are expected to present your model and findings to the class (max 5-10mins)

## Things to keep in mind:
- Make sure that your Training, Testing AND Validation sets contain the same classes of species
- Your validation set is to be used at the very end -- to get a good sense of how your model is performing
- You are expected to compile a CNN in order to correctly classify your selected 15 classes
- Google Colab is your friend - it can help boost your model's training time 
- It can be beneficial to reshape some of the images to reduce some of the data - this will help speed up your model's training time
- Do some research to find out ways to help boost your model's performance (ie data augmentation)
- Make sure to save your model and during the presentation you will load your model and evaluate its performance on the validation set
- Good Luck!
